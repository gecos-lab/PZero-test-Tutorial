# PZero-test Tutorial #

This is a test dataset to be used with the PZero 3D geomodelling application.

The dataset is a simplifications of the Upper Lys Valley, where the contact between the Monte Rosa Nappe and the ophiolites of Zermatt-Saas outcrops. This area has been used by Andrea Bistacchi for years for teaching field geology. The original dataset has been simplifiesd to enhance testing content in the tutorials of PZero, and should be by no means taken as representative of the real geology of the Monte Rosa area.
